// ReachableKeys returns the keys of every object reachable from root — the set
// that must be transferred to hold the whole content — with root first and the
// remaining keys in unspecified order (callers must not rely on any ordering
// beyond root-first), each key listed once even when referenced repeatedly. root
// may be any object type. get fetches the bytes stored under a key; Blob and
// XattrSet objects are leaves and are not fetched.
//
// The walk is a breadth-first sweep that fetches each round's frontier
// concurrently (bounded by GOMAXPROCS), so a wide tree of small objects is read
// in parallel. The current implementation happens to be deterministic — results
// are indexed by frontier position — but that is not part of the contract. get
// must be safe for concurrent use.
