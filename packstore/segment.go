// Package packstore persists Amber-Store CAS objects in log-structured,
// append-only segment (pack) files. The store directory contains only segment
// files: sealed segments are immutable, mmap'd whole, and self-indexed by a
// footer (fanout index on the last key byte + binary fuse filter + fixed
// trailer); the single active segment is recovered by a tail-scan. There is no
// global index. All format integers are big-endian. Record framing lives in the
// amberpack package. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-packstore-design.md.

// Object is one CAS object to store: its key and either its serialized

// the two is set. A Record is parsed (framing, CRC, canonical key, key
// equal to Key) and appended verbatim, so a caller that already holds
// encoded records, say a pack it staged on disk, skips the compression
// round trip; with WriteOpts.Verify its payload is decoded and rehashed
// like Data is.
