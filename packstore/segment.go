// Package packstore persists Amber-Store CAS objects in log-structured,
// append-only segment (pack) files. The store directory contains only segment
// files: sealed segments are immutable, mmap'd whole, and self-indexed by a
// footer (fanout index on the last key byte + binary fuse filter + fixed
// trailer); the single active segment is recovered by a tail-scan. There is no
// global index. All format integers are big-endian. Record framing lives in the
// amberpack package. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-packstore-design.md.
